It helps reduce technical difficulties during the interview by giving the candidate a solution they can use to prepare their enviornmnent with before hand. It is recommeneded that you have this solution build and run smoothly before the day of the challange.

## Steps to confirm if your enviornment is ready for the challange

- Does your solution build?
- Do all the tests under `InterviewSetup.IntegrationTests` run successfully?
- Are you able to successfully debug the tests?

_NOTE:_ There are no challanges to solve in this repository. The solution and tests should all build and pass without any code changes. This is just to confirm if your development enviornment is setup correctly.

_NOTE:_ The database is set to use an in-memory database by default. There is no need for you to provision an actual database instance.
